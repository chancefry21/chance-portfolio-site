## Projects

### **Project 1: March Madness Predictive Modeling**

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib  
**Skills Demonstrated:** data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, sports analytics

Built a logistic regression model to predict NCAA March Madness matchups using team strength indicators from multiple datasets. After merging FiveThirtyEight ratings, historical matchups, and HeatCheck tournament analytics, I engineered features like power rating difference, seed difference, and pool value difference to explain game outcomes.

**Key Results:**
- Training Accuracy: 72%
- Testing Accuracy: 63%
- Power rating difference showed a clear positive relationship with game results
- Model identified real matchup patterns despite the unpredictability of the tournament

### **Project 3: Superstore Analytics Dashboard (Tableau)**

**Tools:** Tableau Desktop, Tableau Public  
**Skills Demonstrated:** data visualization, dashboard design, exploratory data analysis (EDA), multi-year trend analysis, interactive filtering, geographic analysis

Created an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing Superstore sales, profit, and cost data from **2018–2022**. The dashboard highlights product performance, regional profitability, and time-based sales trends using bar charts, maps, and a multi-year line visualization.

**Key Insights:**
- **Technology** generated the highest total sales; **Furniture** generated the least.  
- **Chairs** had the highest sub-category sales; **Tables** sold well but had negative profit.  
- **Binders** had strong sales and were highly profitable; **Phones** showed solid profitability.  
- **Central** region had the highest sales/costs; **East** region had the highest profit.  
- **South** region was unprofitable with the lowest sales and cost levels.  
- Sales show strong seasonality with major spikes in **March**, **September**, and **November** across multiple years.
