## About Me

I recently graduated from Stonehill College with a B.S. in Business Administration, majoring in Marketing with a minor in Data Analytics. Throughout my academic experience and ongoing self-study, I developed a strong interest in data-driven decision-making and using analytics to understand patterns, optimize performance, and support strategic outcomes.

I am actively strengthening my technical foundation in SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization tools while building real-world projects to showcase my skills. My goal is to grow into an analytical role where I can contribute meaningful insights, work with complex datasets, and continue improving as a data professional.
