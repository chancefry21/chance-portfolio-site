# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my data analyst portfolio! This repository highlights my analytical skills, technical abilities, and selected projects that demonstrate my approach to solving data-driven problems. I am continuously learning, building, and refining my abilities as I work toward a career in data analytics.

## About Me

I recently graduated from Stonehill College with a B.S. in Business Administration, majoring in Marketing with a minor in Data Analytics. Throughout my academic experience and ongoing self-study, I developed a strong interest in data-driven decision-making and using analytics to understand patterns, optimize performance, and support strategic outcomes.

I am actively strengthening my technical foundation in SQL, Python, Excel, and visualization tools while building real-world projects to showcase my skills. My goal is to grow into an analytical role where I can contribute meaningful insights, work with complex datasets, and continue improving as a data professional.

## Projects


### **Project 1: March Madness Predictive Modeling**

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
**Skills Demonstrated:** data cleaning, merging multiple datasets, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, sports analytics

Built a logistic regression model to predict NCAA March Madness matchups using team strength indicators from multiple datasets.
After merging FiveThirtyEight ratings, historical matchups, and HeatCheck tournament analytics, I engineered features like power rating difference, seed difference, and pool value difference to explain game outcomes.

**Key Results:**

* Training Accuracy: 72%
* Testing Accuracy: 63%
* Power rating difference showed a clear positive relationship with actual score results
* Model identified real matchup patterns despite the unpredictability of the tournament

## **Project 2: SkyHawk Bank SQL Database**

**Tools:** MySQL, SQL schema design, ERD planning
**Skills Demonstrated:** database design, normalization, query writing, schema creation, data modeling

Built a full relational database for a fictional bank, including customers, accounts, employees, branches, cards, transactions, and account balance history. Designed a complete SQL schema, sample data, and analysis queries to reflect realistic banking operations.

**What’s Included:**

* `tables.sql` — full schema with all relationships
* `inserts.sql` — realistic sample dataset
* `sample-queries.sql` — analytical SQL queries
* `project-presentation.pdf` — slide deck explaining the database
